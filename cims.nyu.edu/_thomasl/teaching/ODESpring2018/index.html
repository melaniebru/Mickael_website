    <h4 class="card-header">Course description</h4>
    <div class="card-block">
    <b>Lectures:</b> Tuesdays 11:00am-12:50am, in CIWW (Courant Institute) 1302.
    <br />
    <b>Office hours:</b> Monday 2-3pm and Thursday 5-6pm, WWH 926.
    <br />
    <b>Course description:</b> fundamentals of ODE (differential equations with one variable). General results for existence/uniqueness, how to find explicit solutions in the linear case and for many particular equations.
    What to say of the solutions when they cannot be found exactly ("qualitative" study)? Are the solutions stable with respect to initial conditions? Then some more special cases where the general theory
    meets concrete examples. Numerical methods and their convergence.<br />

    A mixture of proofs and technical tricks will be presented in class and and the same will be expected in HW's and final exam.
    <br />
    <b>Prerequisites:</b> Real analysis and linear algebra.
    <br />
    <b>Textbook(s):</b> The book of G. Teschl <u>Ordinary Differential Equations
and Dynamical Systems</u> is <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-ode/index.html">available
  freely as PDF file</a> and will be useful at least for the first half of the class.
  <br />
  The book <u>Ordinary differential equations</u> by Vladimir Arnold is recommended for further explorations of the topic.
  The book <u>Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an Introduction to Chaos</u> (Hirsch, Smale, Devaney) is also a good reference.
</a>
    <br />
    <b>Grading:</b> 50% homework, 50% final exam. Homeworks are due on Tuesdays at noon (handed in class, sent by email, or placed in the physical mailbox in front of my office).

  The final exam is scheduled on Tuesday, May 1st at the usual time and place. <br />
  You can find <a href="forfinal.pdf">here</a> the syllabus, as well as instructions concerning the final.<br />
  You can find <a href="forfinal.html">here</a> a list of possible references for the topics we have covered.<br />
  Documents are allowed if they have been written/typed by you (so no books or printed lecture notes),
  and within a reasonable limit.
